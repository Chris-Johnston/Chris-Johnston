# `$ whoami`

I'm Chris Johnston, and I'm a Software Engineer in the greater Seattle area, working on Azure at Microsoft.
The repositories on this page are mostly my own side projects.

[I like blinking LEDs][ledcap], [weird keyboards][bin], and [messing around with IOT stuff][iot]. I also use a lot of C# and Python.

[ledcap]: https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/ledcap
[bin]: https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/binarykeyboard
[iot]: https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/door-monitor
