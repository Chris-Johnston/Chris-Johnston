I'm Chris Johnston, and I'm a Software Engineer in the greater Seattle area, working on Azure at Microsoft.
The repositories on this page are mostly my own side projects.

### I like to make LEDs blink:

This is my animated LED graduation cap, which was controlled by a Raspberry Pi.

### I like weird keyboards:

This is my Binary Keyboard which types in ASCII, one bit at a time.

### And I like playing with IOT stuff:

![Image of my plant sensor board.](https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/Chris-Johnston.github.io/blob/master/images/ha/plant-sensor1.jpg?raw=true)

This is a board I threw together that monitors the soil, light level, temperature, and humidity for my houseplants.
