I'm Chris Johnston, and I'm a Software Engineer in the greater Seattle area, working on Azure at Microsoft.
The repositories on this page are mostly my own side projects which are only infrequently maintained in my free time.

[I like blinking LEDs][ledcap], [weird keyboards][bin], and [messing around with IOT stuff][iot]. Day to day I use a lot of C# and Python.

[ledcap]: https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/ledcap
[bin]: https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/binarykeyboard
[iot]: https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/door-monitor
